I am currently an undergraduate student at McGill University majored in Honours Mathematics and Computer Science, with an expected graduation date of December, 2024. My research interests include machine learning, statistics and their application to medical/biological fields. I am currently exploring the application of conformal inference to drug discovery, and generalizations of the conformal selection framework.
