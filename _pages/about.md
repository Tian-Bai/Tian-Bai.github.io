I recently graduated from McGill University with an Honours B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at Stanford University starting Fall 2025. I am generally interested in statistics and statistical machine learning, and I am particularly piqued by areas such as:

- **Enhancing reliability and trustworthiness of AI/ML Systems**: I am interested in the development and application of methods for accessing and improving the reliability of black-box AI/ML systems (e.g. uncertainty quantification, statistical inference with AI systems), enabling confident deployments in risk-sensitive settings.

- **Understanding foundational aspects of AI/ML Systems**: I am fascinated by the inner workings of complex ML models, which are often opaque. My aim is to gain a deeper understanding of these systems or potentially enhance their transparency through structural modifications.

Currently, I am working on generalizations and applications of conformal inference under the supervision of [Prof. Archer Y. Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/) and also collaborating with [Dr. Ying Jin](https://ying531.github.io/).
